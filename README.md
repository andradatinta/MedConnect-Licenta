# MedConnect - Simplifying CME Credit Management

## Introduction
MedConnect is a web application designed to streamline and simplify the management of Continuous Medical Education (CME) credits for medical professionals in Romania. It addresses the administrative challenges faced by doctors and members of the Romanian College of Physicians (CMR) in tracking CME events and validating credits required for maintaining professional licenses.

The application aims to:
- Digitally optimize the validation process for CME credits.
- Enable real-time tracking and submission of documents required for validation.
- Provide a centralized calendar for CME events, improving accessibility and transparency.

MedConnect leverages modern technologies to reduce bureaucracy, enhance efficiency, and save valuable time for healthcare professionals.

## Key Features
### For Doctors:
- Access a centralized calendar of CME events (local, national, and international).
- Register for events directly through the application.
- Track progress toward annual CME credit requirements.
- View past and upcoming registered events.
- Upload supporting documents (certificates, diplomas) for CME credit validation.

### For CMR Members:
- View and manage the database of registered doctors.
- Validate uploaded documents using an intuitive and modern interface.

### Automation through OCR:
- Uses Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to automatically detect CME credits mentioned in uploaded documents, eliminating manual data entry.

### Technology Stack:
- Built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js).
- Utilizes Firebase Storage for secure document storage.
- Employs Mongoose for database modeling and Axios for HTTP requests.
- Integrated tools include SendGrid for email notifications, pdf-parse for PDF text extraction, and Tesseract.js for OCR capabilities.

## Why MedConnect?
Currently, there are no web or mobile applications dedicated to addressing the administrative challenges of CME credit management for Romanian physicians. Existing platforms, such as Medichub and medical-congresses, only provide access to events partnered with their platforms, lacking transparency and comprehensive event centralization.

MedConnect stands out by offering:
- Full transparency for all CME events, regardless of the organizer.
- Tools for seamless tracking and validation of CME credits.
- Automated credit detection, minimizing manual data entry.

## Objectives
MedConnect was developed with the following objectives:
- Simplify CME credit validation and progress tracking.
- Reduce administrative workload for doctors and CMR members.
- Centralize CME event listings for improved accessibility.
- Provide a scalable and user-friendly solution using modern web technologies.

## Conclusion
MedConnect aims to transform CME credit management by providing an efficient, transparent, and user-friendly platform for medical professionals and administrative staff. It reduces paperwork, automates manual processes, and centralizes event management, making it an essential tool for optimizing time and resources in the medical field.
